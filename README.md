# programm_for_Owen_PLC210
This project is a Windows-based application for controlling and monitoring devices via Modbus TCP/RTU, designed to work with the OVEN PLC 210. It provides a user-friendly WPF interface to send control signals, manage strobe parameters (frequency, duty cycle, type), and communicate with coils and registers of the PLC.
